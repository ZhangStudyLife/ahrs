New release 0.4 is out!

AHRS is a collection of functions and algorithms in pure Python used to estimate the orientation of mobile systems.

Orginally, an [AHRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_and_heading_reference_system) is a set of orthogonal sensors providing attitude information about an aircraft. This field has now expanded to smaller devices, like wearables, automated transportation and all kinds of systems in motion.

This package's focus is **fast prototyping**, **education**, **testing** and **modularity**. Performance is _NOT_ the main goal. For optimized implementations there are endless resources in C/C++ or Fortran.

AHRS is compatible with **Python 3.9** and newer.

## Installation

The most recommended method is to install AHRS directly from this repository to get the latest version:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Mayitzin/ahrs.git
cd ahrs
python -m pip install .
```

Or using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) for the stable releases:

```shell
pip install ahrs
```

AHRS depends merely on [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). More packages are avoided, to reduce its third-party dependency.

## Versioning
In order to update the version, use hatch and adjust it automatically

```shell
hatch version <major, minor, patch>
```

- All functions and objects are [Type hinted](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/).
- [Metrics](https://ahrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metrics.html) are now improved to compute faster, when vectorization is possible.
- Classes `Quaternion` and `QuaternionArray` are now derived from `numpy.ndarray`. This allows to use them as regular NumPy arrays, with all their methods and properties.
- A whole bunch of [new constant values](https://ahrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/constants.html) accessed from the top level of the package.
- All estimators are tested.
- Several fixes in implementation and documentation are applied.

For a thorough list of changes, please check the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Attitude Estimators

One of the most useful parts are the attitude estimation algorithms.

All estimators are refactored to be consistent with the corresponding articles describing them. They have in-code references to the equations, so that you can follow the original articles along with the code.

These estimators are based on two main solutions:

- [Wahba's Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahba%27s_problem) (WP), which finds a rotation matrix between two coordinate systems. This means we compare measurement vectors against reference vectors. Their difference is the rotation. The solution to Wahba's problem mainly compares accelerometers and magnetometers against the gravitational and geomagnetic vectors, correspondingly.
- [Dead Reckoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning) (DR) integrating the measured local angular velocity to increasingly estimate the angular position of the sensor.

Implemented attitude estimators are:

| UKF           | YES       | YES           | Optional     |

To use the sensor data to estimate the attitude simply pass the data to a desired estimator, and it will automatically estimate the quaternions with the given parameters.

```python
>>> attitude = ahrs.filters.Madgwick(acc=acc_data, gyr=gyro_data)
>>> attitude.Q.shape
(6959, 4)
```

Some algorithms allow a finer tuning of its estimation with different parameters. Check their documentation to see what can be tuned.

```python
>>> attitude = ahrs.filters.Madgwick(acc=acc_data, gyr=gyro_data, mag=mag_data, gain=0.1, frequency=100.0)
```

## Documentation

A comprehensive documentation, with examples, is available in
[Read the Docs](https://ahrs.readthedocs.io).

## Note for future versions

`ahrs` focuses on the algorithmic parts. Submodules `io` and `plot` have been removed from the package and codebase already.
